            Christmas & New Year's in my hometown - slower pace, family bonding, and stress relief

    <!-- TIMELINE 1 - Province -->
    <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-text">
            <h2>Back to the Province</h2>
            <p>I would first like to say that my time spent during Christmas and New Year's was fairly uneventful. I did what most Filipinos do - I went back to our provinces and visited my lola as well as my friends that I long have not seen in person.</p>
            <p>Not much had happened during my time at my hometown. It was relatively peaceful compared to La Trinidad. There was no constant noise from cars passing by, the days were always sunny, and people were just doing their everyday work with no rush.</p>

    <!-- TIMELINE 2 - Christmas Dinner -->
    <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-text">
            <h2>Christmas Family Dinner</h2>
            <p>When Christmas came, my family and cousins came together and I went and helped out in preparing food. It was nothing much, just some simple dinner like spaghetti, barbecues, and different kinds of cooked chicken to accommodate our picky younger cousins and elderly.</p>
            <p>When it came time to eat, my cousins and elders naturally came together and caught up with each other as they talked about their lives. The same goes for me and my cousins that are around my age.</p>

    <!-- TIMELINE 3 - Swimming -->
    <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-text">
            <h2>Surprising Swim</h2>
            <p>After our party came to an end and some couple of days passed by, my cousin invited me to go on a swimming trip with them. Naturally, I agreed and went with them. What I did not know was that he was to be baptized as well so naturally I was a little shocked and surprised.</p>
            <p>After that happened we naturally enjoyed our time at the pool and went home. It was a perfect unexpected adventure during the holidays.</p>

    <!-- TIMELINE 4 - New Year -->
    <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-text">
            <h2>A New Year's Reflection</h2>
            <p>While December passed by and the New Year came we had another party at my cousin's home. I had a productive discussion about what we wanted to do and the future and what our plans for this new year.</p>
            <p>After which I stayed at our house and played with my brothers to pass the days until school was near.</p>

            <h2>A Simple End</h2>
            <p>I wouldn't call it an amazing vacation, but it was peaceful and exactly what I needed after a stressful semester. Simple moments with family and friends made it memorable.</p>
            <p>Now back to reality and schoolwork, but with good memories and a refreshed mind. 🏠✨</p>
