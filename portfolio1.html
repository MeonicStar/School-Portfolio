            <h2>🏡 Back to the Province</h2>
            <p>I would first like to say that my time spent during Christmas and New Year's was fairly uneventful. I did what most Filipinos do - I went back to our provinces and visited my lola as well as my friends that I long have not seen in person.</p>
            <p>Not much had happened during my time at my hometown. It was relatively peaceful compared to La Trinidad. There was no constant noise from cars passing by, the days were always sunny, and people were just doing their everyday work with no rush. It felt like time was slower and people were content with life.</p>

            <h2>🎄 Christmas Family Dinner</h2>
            <p>When Christmas came, my family and cousins came together and I went and helped out in preparing food. It was nothing much, just some simple dinner like spaghetti, barbecues, and different kinds of cooked chicken to accommodate our picky younger cousins and elderly.</p>
            <p>When it came time to eat, my cousins and elders naturally came together and caught up with each other as they talked about their lives. The same goes for me and my cousins that are around my age as we discussed changes that happened at my hometown and stories of what they have previously been through.</p>

            <h2>🏊 Surprise Baptism & Swim</h2>
            <p>After our party came to an end and some couple of days passed by, my cousin invited me to go on a swimming trip with them. Naturally, I agreed and went with them. What I did not know was that he was to be baptized as well so naturally I was a little shocked and surprised.</p>
            <p>After that happened we naturally enjoyed our time at the pool and went home. It was a perfect unexpected adventure during the holidays.</p>

            <p>While December passed by and the New Year came we had another party at my cousin's home. I had a productive discussion about what we wanted to do and the future and what our plans for this new year. After which I stayed at our house and played with my brothers to pass the days until school was near.</p>

            <h2>✨ Why It Was Perfect</h2>
            <p>I wouldn't say that my time spent at my hometown was boring but it was a stress relief as I took back my time, slowed down, took care of my health, and talked to my friends and family that I have much neglected when I was at school focused on my academics.</p>
            <p>It was comforting to say the least that I had a much better vacation here in my hometown than staying at our house at La Trinidad playing games all day with nothing much to do. Thank you for reading my story and have a nice day.</p>
